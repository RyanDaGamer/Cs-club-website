    <h2>Some random facts no one asked for :)</h2>
      <p> Garald is a character I made in third grade when I was bored in math. I worked with my friends to make a comic series out of it. </p>
    <p> Garald is pronounced "Gair-ald".</p>
    <p> Invasion of the Don-ufo is a project I made for  gamejam 2 years back. The name is a play on the words "donut" and "UFO". It was the first unity game I made on my own.</p>
      <p> Many of my projects were majorly coded by others (except for Garald Rush and Invasion of the Donufo)</p>
    <p> I am horrible at programming and anything related </p>
